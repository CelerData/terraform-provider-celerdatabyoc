# Provision CelerData Cloud BYOC on AWS

Deploy a CelerData Cloud BYOC cluster on AWS step by step:

- [Preparations](#preparations)
- [Configure providers](#configure-providers)
- [Describe infrastructure](#describe-infrastructure)
- [Apply configurations](#apply-configurations)

Read this article before you start a Terraform configuration for your cluster deployment on AWS.

## Preparations

Before using the CelerData Cloud BYOC provider to create infrastructure at the AWS account level for the first time, you must complete the following preparations:

### AWS prerequisites

1. Have an AWS account with administrative privileges.
2. Have an AWS S3 bucket.
3. Have an IAM user, to which the following policy is attached, and create an access key pair for the IAM user:

   ```terraform
   {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
           {
               "Effect": "Allow",
               "Action": [
                   "iam:CreateRole",
                   "iam:PutRolePolicy",
                   "iam:GetRole",
                   "iam:ListRolePolicies",
                   "iam:GetRolePolicy",
                   "iam:ListAttachedRolePolicies",
                   "iam:ListInstanceProfilesForRole",
                   "iam:DeleteRolePolicy",
                   "iam:DeleteRole",
                   "iam:CreateInstanceProfile",
                   "iam:GetInstanceProfile",
                   "iam:RemoveRoleFromInstanceProfile",
                   "iam:DeleteInstanceProfile",
                   "iam:AddRoleToInstanceProfile",
                   "iam:PassRole"
               ],
               "Resource": "*"
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

### CelerData prrerequisites

Obtain the credentials with which you can authenticate into the CelerData Cloud BYOC platform. For details, see [Authentication](../index.md#authentication).

### Terraform prerequisites

1. Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) in your terminal.

2. Have a Terraform project. In your terminal, create an empty directory (for example, `terraform`) and then switch to it. (Each separate set of Terraform configuration files must be in its own directory, which is called a Terraform project.)

## Configure providers

This section assumes that you have [completed the preparations](#preparations).

Create a **`.tf`** file (for example, **`main.tf`**) in your Terraform project. Then, add the following code snippet to the **`.tf`** file:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    celerdatabyoc = {
      source = "CelerData/celerdatabyoc"
      version = "<provider_version>"
    }
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "4.26.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "celerdatabyoc" {
  client_id = "<client_id>"
  client_secret = "<client_secret>"
}

provider "aws" {
  region     = "<region_name>"
  access_key = "<your_access_key>"
  secret_key = "<your_secret_key>"
}

locals {
  s3_bucket = "<bucket_name>" 
}
```

The parameters you need to specify are as follows:

- `provider_version`: Enter the CelerData provider version of your choice. We recommend that you select the latest provider version, for example `version = "1.0.2"`. You can view the provider versions offered by CelerData Cloud BYOC from the [CelerData Cloud BYOC provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/CelerData/celerdatabyoc/latest/docs) page.
- `client_id` and `client_secret`: Enter the **Client ID** and **Secret** of your application key. See "[For CelerData](#preparations)."
- `region_name`: Enter the ID of the AWS region in which you want your CelerData cluster to run. See [Supported cloud platforms and regions](https://docs.celerdata.com/BYOC/docs/get_started/cloud_platforms_and_regions/#aws).
- `access_key` and `secret_key`: Enter the access key ID ("access key" for short) and secret access key ("secret key" for short) of your access key pair. See "[For AWS](#preparations)." For security purposes, you can set the access key and secret key as [environment variables](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#provider-configuration).
- `s3_bucket`: Enter the name of your S3 bucket. This way, the bucket element is set as a local value, and you can then directly set the argument for the bucket element in your Terraform configuration to `local.s3_bucket` to save time. See [Local Values](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/locals).

## Describe infrastructure

This section provides a sample infrastructure configuration that automates the deployment of a classic CelerData cluster on AWS to help you understand how you can work with the CelerData Cloud BYOC provider. It assumes that you have [completed the preparations](#preparations) and have [configured the providers](#configure-providers).

To create a classic CelerData cluster, you need to declare the following resources, which represent the infrastructure to be built, in the **`.tf`** file (for example, **`main.tf`**) in which you have configured the providers.

### Data credential-related resources

```terraform
data "celerdatabyoc_aws_data_credential_assume_policy" "assume_role" {}

resource "celerdatabyoc_aws_data_credential_policy" "role_policy" {
  bucket = local.s3_bucket
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "celerdata_data_cred_role" {
  name               = "<celerdata_data_credential_role_name>"
  assume_role_policy = data.celerdatabyoc_aws_data_credential_assume_policy.assume_role.json
  description        = "<celerdata_data_credential_role_description>"
  inline_policy {
    name   = "<celerdata_data_credential_role_policy_name>"
    policy = celerdatabyoc_aws_data_credential_policy.role_policy.json
  }
}

resource "celerdatabyoc_aws_data_credential" "data_credential" {
  name = "<celerdata_data_credential_name>"
  role_arn = aws_iam_role.celerdata_data_cred_role.arn
  instance_profile_arn = aws_iam_instance_profile.celerdata_data_cred_profile.arn
  bucket_name = local.s3_bucket
  policy_version = celerdatabyoc_aws_data_credential_policy.role_policy.version
}
```

#### [`celerdatabyoc_aws_data_credential_policy`](../resources/aws_data_credential_policy.md)

This resource contains only the following required argument:

- `bucket`: (Forces new resource) The name of the AWS S3 bucket for which to generate the JSON policy document and that stores query profiles. Set this argument to `local.s3_bucket`, as we recommend that you set the bucket element as a local value `s3_bucket` in your Terraform configuration. See [Local Values](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/locals).

#### `aws_iam_role` (celerdata_data_cred_role)

This resource contains the following required arguments and optional arguments:

**Required:**

- `assume_role_policy`: The policy that grants an entity permission to assume the IAM role referenced in the data credential. Set the value to `data.celerdatabyoc_aws_data_credential_assume_policy.assume_role.json`.

**Optional:**

- `name`: (Forces new resource) The name of the IAM role referenced in the data credential. Enter a unique name. If omitted, Terraform will assign a random, unique name. See [IAM Identifiers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html) for more information.

```

## Apply configurations

After you finish [configuring the providers](#configure-providers) and [describing the infrastructure objects](#describe-infrastructure) in your Terraform configuration, follow these steps to apply the configuration in your Terraform project:

1. Initialize and install the providers defined in the Terraform configuration:

   ```sh
   terraform init
   ```

2. Verify that your Terraform project has been properly configured:

   ```sh
   terraform plan
   ```

   If there are any errors, edit the Terraform configuration and re-run the preceding command.

3. Apply the Terraform configuration:

   ```sh
   terraform apply
   ```

When the system returns a "Apply complete!" message, the Terraform configuration has been successfully applied.

~> After you change the provider versions in the Terraform configuration, you must run `terraform init -upgrade` to initialize the providers and then run `terraform apply` again to apply the Terraform configuration.

## Delete configurations

You can delete your Terraform configuration if you no longer need it.

Deleting a Terraform configuration means destroying all resources created by the CelerData Cloud BYOC provider.

To delete a Terraform configuration, run the following command in your Terraform project:

```SQL
terraform destroy
```

When the system returns a "Destroy complete!" message, the Terraform configuration has been successfully deleted and the cluster created by the Terraform configuration is also released.
