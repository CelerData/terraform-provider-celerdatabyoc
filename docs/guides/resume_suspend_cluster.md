# Resume or suspend a cluster

This topic describes how to resume or suspend a CelerData cluster.

~> The following examples assume that the cluster you want to resume or suspend is a classic cluster, and the ellipses (...) in the following examples refer to the other existing arguments you have specified in the `celerdatabyoc_classic_cluster` resource.

## Example Usage - Resume Cluster

1. Set the `expected_cluster_state` argument to `Running` in the Terraform configuration, as shown below:

   ```terraform
   resource "celerdatabyoc_classic_cluster" "classic_cluster" {
     ...
     expected_cluster_state = "Running" 
   }
   ```

2. (Optional) Check whether your project has been configured. If there are any errors, edit the configuration and re-run the following command:

    ```Plain
    terraform plan
    ```

3. Apply the configuration:

   ```Plain
   terraform apply
   ```

   When the system returns "Apply complete!", the cluster is successfully resumed.

## Example Usage - Suspend Cluster

1. Add the `expected_cluster_state` argument to `Suspended` in the Terraform configuration, as shown below:

   ```terraform
   resource "celerdatabyoc_classic_cluster" "classic_cluster" {
     ...
     expected_cluster_state = "Suspended" 
   }
   ```

2. (Optional) Check whether your project has been configured. If there are any errors, edit the configuration and re-run the following command:

   ```Plain
   terraform plan
   ```

3. Apply the configuration:

   ```Plain
   terraform apply
   ```

   When the system returns "Apply complete!", the cluster is suspended.

## Argument Reference

The argument is described as follows:

- `expected_cluster_state`: The status of the CelerData cluster. To resume a cluster, set the argument to `Running`. To suspend a cluster, set the argument to `Suspended`.
