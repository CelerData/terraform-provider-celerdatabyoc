~> The resource's API may change in subsequent versions to simplify user experience.

A network configuration for GCP defines the network infrastructure such as the virtual network and subnet that hosts your CelerData cluster deployment, as well as the security rules that control the incoming and outgoing traffic of the CelerData cluster. For more detail see [Create a Project and Enable Necessary APIs](https://docs.celerdata.com/BYOC/docs/sql-reference/gcp/create_project_enable_api/) and [Creates a network configuration for GCP in CelerData Cloud BYOC](https://docs.celerdata.com/BYOC/docs/sql-reference/gcp/create_vpc_network_subnet_firewall_rule/).

The implementation of this resource can be part of the whole cluster deployment procedure. You can find details about the cluster deployment procedure in [Provision CelerData Cloud BYOC on GCP](../guides/gcp_deployment_guide.md). You can also implement this resource separately to create a data credential, which then can be reused together with the matching data credential and deployment credential many times to deploy clusters.
## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "celerdatabyoc_gcp_network" "network_credential" {
  name = "<network_credential_name>"
  region = "<region_name>"
  subnet = "<subnet>"
  network_tag = "<network_tag>"
  deployment_credential_id = "<deployment_credential_id>"
}
```

## Argument Reference

~> This section explains only the arguments of the `celerdatabyoc_gcp_network` resource. For the explanation of arguments of other resources, see the corresponding resource topics.

This resource contains the following required arguments and optional arguments:

**Required:**

- `name`: (Forces new resource) The name of the network configuration. Enter a unique name.

- `region`: (Forces new resource) The Name of the GCP region.

- `subnet`: (Forces new resource) The Name of GCP subnet.

- `network_tag`: (Forces new resource) The target tag of the firewall rules that you use to enable connectivity between cluster nodes within your own VPC and between CelerData's VPC and your own VPC over TLS.

- `deployment_credential_id`: (Forces new resource) The ID of the deployment credential. [celerdatabyoc_gcp_deployment_credential](../resources/gcp_deployment_credential.md)

**Optional:**

- `psc_connection_id`: (Forces new resource) The ID of the [Private Service Connect](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect) connection that you create to allow direct, secure connectivity between CelerData's VPC and your own VPC.
  
  For information about how to create a PSC Connection, see [Create a Private Service Connect Endpoint](https://docs.celerdata.com/BYOC/docs/sql-reference/gcp/create_psc_endpoint/).
  NOTE:
    - If PSC connection ID is not set, then the Private Service Connect connection will not be built, CelerData's VPC communicates with your own VPC over the Internet.
    - If you have enabled Shared VPC, you should enter the ID of the PSC Connection from the service project (that is, the project where the cluster is deployed)..

## Attribute Reference

This resource exports the following attributes:'

- `id`: The ID of the network configuration.
