~> The resource's API may change in subsequent versions to simplify user experience.

The implementation of this resource can be part of the cluster deployment procedure. You can find details about the cluster deployment procedure in [Provision CelerData Cloud BYOC on GCP](../guides/gcp_deployment_guide.md). You can also implement this resource separately to create a deployment credential, which then can be reused together with the matching data credential and network configuration many times to deploy clusters. For more detail see [Creates a deployment credential for GCP in CelerData Cloud BYOC](https://docs.celerdata.com/BYOC/docs/sql-reference/gcp/grant_resource_permission/).

This resource is also a prerequisite for the implementation of the credential-related resource [`celerdatabyoc_gcp_network`](../resources/gcp_network.md) required for cluster deployment.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "celerdatabyoc_gcp_deployment_credential" "deployment_credential" {
  name = "<deployment_credential_name>"
  project_id = "<project_id>"
}
```
