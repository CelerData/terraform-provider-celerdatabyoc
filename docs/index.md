# CelerData Cloud Private Provider

The CelerData Cloud Private provider is used to configure the infrastructure that hosts your CelerData resources. You must configure the provider with proper credentials before you can use it. Currently the provider supports deployments on both AWS and Azure:

- On AWS, you can deploy cluster or elastic clusters. See [Provision CelerData Cloud Private on AWS](../docs/guides/aws_deployment_guide.md).
- On Azure, you can deploy only classic clusters. See [Provision CelerData Cloud Private on Azure](../docs/guides/azure_deployment_guide.md).

To learn more about the basics of Terraform using this provider, follow the hands-on tutorials provided in "Guides" in the navigation to the left.

You can also find documentation regarding the resources and data sources supported by this provider in the navigation to the left.
